## Date Pickers

### Support for time zones

No more hassle displaying dates on the time zones of your choice. üåé

You can effortlessly display and select dates and times in different time zones, without worrying about the conversion logic and keeping the stored value consistent with your backend.

Use adapters to control the original value and set the `timezone` prop to define in which timezone the Date, Time, or DateTime should be displayed.

```tsx
<TimePicker
  value={value} // Can be in any timezone of your choice
  onChange={setValue}
  timezone="Pacific/Honolulu"
  label={'Rendered in "Pacific/Honolulu"'}
/>
```

Please check the [full instructions](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/timezone/) for more information on using this feature in your application.

### Digital clock

This feature is an alternative to the analog clock on time pickers; the original proposal was mainly focused on mobile devices, whereas the new interface is designed for a desktop experience or better time precision.
This new addition makes our date pickers even more versatile and user-friendly and is available as the default variant for desktops on both [TimePicker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/time-picker/) and [DateTimePicker](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/date-time-picker/).

Check out all the possibilities in [documentation](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/digital-clock/), and let us know your thoughts!

## Data Grid

### Copy and Paste[<span class="plan-premium"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#premium-plan)

After setting the prop `experimentalFeatures={{ clipboardPaste: true }}` you can copy and paste data directly from and to your Data Grid.

This new feature is extremely versatile, and you can exchange data from other fields, other grids, and even directly from and to Microsoft Excel.

  <source src="/static/blog/mui-x-mid-v6-features/copy_paste.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

This feature is integrated with the editing API, so pasted data can be persisted using the `processRowUpdate` prop to update your data source through your usual editing validation process.
Furthermore, the callbacks `clipboardPasteStart` and `clipboardPasteEnd` are fired during the clipboard paste operation, which can be useful for extra customizations around the event.

For more details on how to use clipboard copy and paste, check out the [feature's page](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/clipboard/).

### Filter on column headers[<span class="plan-pro"></span>](/x/introduction/licensing/#pro-plan)

This feature allows users to quickly filter the data without needing any additional menu and can be activated using the `unstable_headerFilters` prop.

The new filter fields are displayed below the headers and are synchronized with the filter panel, but for those seeking more simplicity, disable the default filter panel using `disableColumnFilter` prop and set filters to use only the default operator.
You can also customize the header filter cell for a specific column using the `renderHeaderFilter` method of `GridColDef`

For more details on how to use and customize the filters, check out its [documentation page](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/filtering/header-filters/).

### Performance Enhancements: Smoother Scrolling and Expanding Rows

The Data Grid received significant performance improvements in MUI X v6, particularly concerning the data grid's scrolling efficiency and the expansion of children's rows.

These performance upgrades are part of our ongoing commitment to provide end-users with a superior experience.
We always strive to ensure that MUI X remains performant and efficient, particularly when dealing with large and complex data.

## Charts - alpha version üéÅ

We are delighted to announce the upcoming expansion of MUI X‚Äì a brand-new suite of components specifically designed for building and easily customizing appealing charts.

With MUI X Charts, you can choose from a wide range of chart types, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, area charts, scatter plots, and more. Each chart type is thoughtfully crafted with attention to detail, ensuring that the visual representations are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly effective in conveying complex data.

And it ships with a couple of rad palettes, specially crafted by our designers!
